## Welcome to an Agar.io clone made by Davi and Henry

Please visit our profiles for more information about us

[Agar.io](https://agar.io) is a 2-d online multiplayer action game. The purpose of the game is to grow as a cell and consume other cells while trying to stay alive. We were inspired on it since it is one of our childhood favorite games, and we have been playing it for over a decade! So we decided to create our own agar.io clone with our own twists on it.

Currently, the game will be simple, but we will eventually add bot machine learning algorithms. We are also thinking of adding new twists like
special viruses which are viruses that can move by themselves and viruses that make you decay tremendously once consumed - these spawn randomly. 

GOALS FOR THIS WEEK:

- [ ] MOVEMENT
- [ ] RENDER CELL
- [ ] EATING

Deadline will be two months...
