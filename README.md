[Agar.io](https://agar.io) is a 2-d online multiplayer action game. The purpose of the game is to grow as a cell and consume other cells while trying to stay alive. We were inspired on it since it is one of our childhood favorite games, and we have been playing it for over a decade! So we decided to create our own agar.io clone with our own twists on it.
